<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am an Interaction Designer with a passion for problem-solving. My experience in diverse domains such as UI/UX Design, <br>
  Design Research, Design Strategy, Graphic Design & Branding, and AR & VR, as well as interdepartmental collaboration <br>
  in the projects I have worked on, has provided me with a strong foundation of technical skills and communication. <br>
  I enjoy building engaging and user-centric digital experiences and am excited to learn and collaborate on the same!</p>

<p>I am currently reworking my portfolio as well as dabbling into the domain of front end development. I was first <br>
  introduced to coding in high school and have always had a liking for it. I am currently pursuing Dr. Angela Yu's Web Dev Bootcamp<br>
to learn how to code better</p>
